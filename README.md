A little weekend project to implement a python wrapper for the [Coin Market Cap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#section/Introduction).

See `tests.py` for usage examples and `pyCMC/__init__.py` for function documentation.

The constructor takes your API key as the sole argument.

I don't have a paid plan so I cannot test that functionality.

TODO:
- Add setup script.
- Add/test paid functionality.
- Better input screening and error messages.

Issues and PRs welcome :).
